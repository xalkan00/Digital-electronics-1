## 2.Bidirectional counter. Submit:

### 2.1 Listing of VHDL code of the process p_cnt_up_down with syntax highlighting.
### 2.2 Listing of VHDL reset and stimulus processes from testbench file tb_cnt_up_down.vhd with syntax highlighting and asserts,
### 2.3 Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs,


## 3.Top level. Submit:

### 3.1 Listing of VHDL code from source file top.vhd with all instantiations for the 4-bit bidirectional counter.
### 3.2 (Hand-drawn) sketch of the top layer including both counters, ie a 4-bit bidirectional counter from Part 4 and a 16-bit counter with a different time base from Part Experiments on your own.
