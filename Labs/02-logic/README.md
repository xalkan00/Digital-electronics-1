Digital or Binary comparator compares the digital signals A, B presented at input terminal and produce outputs depending upon the condition of those inputs. Complete the truth table for 2-bit Identity comparator (B equals A), and two Magnitude comparators (B is greater than A, B is less than A). Note that, such a digital device has four inputs and three outputs/functions.
